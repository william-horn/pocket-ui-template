# Source Analysis

### Vocab:

- **Literature** means other research

### Rules:

Quotes longer than 3 lines should be indented, as they will be considered _block quotes_. You may include elipces (...) to cut out redundant partials of the quote.

### For each summary:

- Summarize the focus, thesis, and/or research
- Questions of your author(s) or researcher(s)
- Why what they're saying matters
- etc... (source: https://fmarion.blackboard.com/ultra/courses/_16893_1/cl/outline)
